# 👋  Welcome

Welcome to Inxton documentation, a steadily growing collection of guides, documentation and API reference for Inxton. 

Expand the menu on the left, and pick a topic that you find interesting!

Checkout out **[TcOpen](https://github.com/TcOpenGroup/TcOpen)** Open source for TwinCAT 3 with many contributions from Inxton developers.

TcOpen has its own documentation at [docs.TcOpenGroup.com](https://docs.tcopengroup.org/). This documentation has more focus on programming and less on Inxton.
