# Inxton.Vortex.Framework

*Inxton.Vortex.Framework* is a set of tools and libraries that allow for the fast development of industrial applications involving Beckhoff TwinCat 3 PLCs'. You can combine the power of deterministic behavior of the PLC with the wealth of possibilities offered by the .net ecosystem.

## Tiny bit of history

Inxton.Vortex.Framework is the result of about a decade of development inside a machine-building company [MTS](https://mts.sk/en).

This framework was initially used as an internal tool. It allowed us to develop the industrial applications way faster than we were able to do before. At the same time, we could deliver features in our applications that were unachievable with current technologies.   There was an increasing demand from our customers as well as from the other machine builders to provide them with this tooling. We decided some time ago to refactor, rewrite, document and optimize the libraries and tooling so that you all can benefit from our decade long effort to bring PLC world closer to the .net ecosystem. We have also established a team that will continue to develop and support the developers.

Here we are coming with the results. We will progressively release several packages with tons of useful tools and features.

## Note to preview versions

The packages will be first released as preview versions. These versions are close to the final release. With previews we are just giving you the opportunity to start working with new versions, to comment and give us feedback before the final release. Preview versions are subject to change and from time to time those changes can break some of your existing code. You should not use preview versions in production, but you can start using them in development. For each preview version, we will indicate the date of the planned full release. Also, be aware that the preview version license will expire about the time the full release is issued.
