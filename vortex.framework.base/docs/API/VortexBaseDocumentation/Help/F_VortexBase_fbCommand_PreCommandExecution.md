# fbCommand.PreCommandExecution Field
 _**\[This is preliminary documentation and is subject to change.\]**_

Allows or prevents the execution of the command based on return from the delegate. If delegate is not assigned the execution will be allowed by default. When the delegate is assigned it must return 'true' to be executed. PreCommandExecution can execute arbitrary logic such as dialogue window, information for the user about the execution of the command, etc.
